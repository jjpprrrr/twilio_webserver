Description: Tungsten
        --------
        
        Tungsten is a dead simple Wolfram Alpha API wrapper built for python, with all the power and none of the hassle. Check it out:
        
            import tungsten
        
            client = tungsten.Tungsten('appid')
            result = client.query('pi')
        
            for pod in pods:
                print pod.scanner
        
        Of course, that stuff is pretty simple. Tungsten can handle a lot more.
        
            # Query parameters
            params = {'format': ['plaintext', 'image', 'minput', 'moutput'],
                      'scanner': 'numeric',
                      'parsetimeout': 10}
            result = client.query('rref {{1,2},{3,4}}', params)
        
            # Various formats
            mathematica_input = result.pods[1].format['minput']
            image = result.pods[1].format['img']
        
            # Piping queries
            piped_result = client.query(mathematica_input)
